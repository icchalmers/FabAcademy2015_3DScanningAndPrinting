# FabAcademy2015_3DScanningAndPrinting

This is my Week5: 3D Scanning and Printing assignment as part [Fab Academy 2015](http://www.fabacademy.org/) at [Fab Lab Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/fablab/). You can follow the process on [my class website](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/chalmers.iain/index.html).

# Cubify Sense Scanning

I was scanned using a [Cubify Sense](http://cubify.com/products/sense), in two different poses.

The two meshes were then cleaned up in [MeshMixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/) before being printed on a [MakerBot Replicator 2x](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2x).

In the images below, the fixed meshes are on the left.

# Roland MDX-20 Scanning

I scanned a broken oven knob using the Roland MDX-20. Two scans were taken: one of the outside, one of the inside. Both were taken with an XY resolution of 0.3mm. 

The two resulting meshes were combined in MeshMixer and the resulting part printed to scale.
